# maxxpotential-web-project
A simple portfolio website we built at the MaxxPotential Career Lab Day.
[Source Event:](https://maxxpotential.com/career-lab/)

### Resources
Files provided to make website: [/resources](/resources)

## Pesonal Notes:

The provided images where very large so I decided to resize/compress them using Affinity.  
It was suggested we could use a code editor(sublime text) and Bootstrap to build the website.  
I chose to code it from scratch.

## Post Career Lab Day

I updated the code to make it responsive.
